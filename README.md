.ino file is uploaded to arduino (Arduino Code for collecting sensor data and sending it over serial).

The files in the folder contain everything needed to run the p5.js sketch locally. Running 'index' launches the sketch.

p5.serialcontrol software is used so that the p5.js sketch is able to read data from serial connection.
